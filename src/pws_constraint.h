     * "|" symbol, and the second element is the part of the sequence that may
     * lie on either side of the "|" symbol.

     * The sequences are represented as a list of maps, for example,
     * {z=1, y=3}, {x=2}. If more than one write are present in a map, the map
     * describes any sequence that is some ordering of it's elements. Thus, the
     * above example describes both z=1:y=3:x=2 and y=3:z=1:x=2, but not
     * z=1:x=2:y=3. Also, the maps may contain the value "*" (represented by
     * value_t::STAR), which describes any write to that memory location.
     *
     * Invariants: In each sequence pair, each memory location may only appear
     *             in one map.
