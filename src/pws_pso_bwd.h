/* This class is a wrapper for Bwd when used for PwsConstraints. It executes
 * exactly as Bwd, but converts the PWS trace into a PSO trace before returning
 * the result.
 * 
 * It is implemented on top of SbTsoBwd because the brunt of the work
 * (associating transitions that produce messages with their corresponding
 * updates and then reordering the process interleaving of the trace so it
 * becomes a TSO/PSO trace) is the same for SB and PWS traces, and the only
 * additional work needed for PWS is to filter out serialise transitions.
